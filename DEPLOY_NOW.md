# ðŸš€ Deploy Your Anime Blog App Now!

Follow these simple steps to deploy your application:

## Step 1: Configure AWS Credentials

First, you need to configure your AWS credentials. Run:

```bash
aws configure
```

Enter your:
- AWS Access Key ID
- AWS Secret Access Key
- Default region (use: us-east-1)
- Default output format (use: json)

## Step 2: Deploy Backend with Amplify

Run this command to deploy your backend:

```bash
npx ampx sandbox
```

This will:
- Create DynamoDB tables for your data
- Set up Cognito for authentication
- Deploy your GraphQL API
- Generate the configuration file

The deployment will take about 5-10 minutes.

## Step 3: Update Your Code to Use Amplify API

While the backend is deploying, update your home page to use the Amplify-integrated components:

1. Open `app/home/page.tsx`
2. Change line 11 from:
   ```typescript
   import { UserPosts } from '@/components/UserPosts'
   ```
   To:
   ```typescript
   import { SimpleUserPosts as UserPosts } from '@/components/SimpleUserPosts'
   ```

## Step 4: Test Your Application

Once the deployment is complete:

1. The terminal will show "âœ… Sandbox deployed successfully"
2. Your app will automatically connect to the deployed backend
3. Run your app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## What You Can Do Now:

âœ… Create user accounts (data persists in AWS Cognito)
âœ… Create blog posts (data saves to DynamoDB)
âœ… Upload images (stored in S3)
âœ… View your posts even after logging out
âœ… Comment on posts (saved to database)

## Deploy to Production (Optional)

To deploy your frontend to Amplify Hosting:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add social features"
git push origin main
```

Your app will automatically deploy to: https://dzgvj1gqwfjbu.amplifyapp.com

## Troubleshooting

If you get credential errors:
1. Make sure you have an AWS account
2. Create an IAM user with AdministratorAccess
3. Use those credentials in `aws configure`

If the sandbox command fails:
1. Try: `npx ampx sandbox delete` first
2. Then run: `npx ampx sandbox` again

## Need Help?

The app is already configured and ready to deploy. You just need to:
1. Configure AWS credentials
2. Run the sandbox command
3. Start coding!
