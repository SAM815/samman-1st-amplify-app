[2025-07-29T02:06:23.525Z] [npx-sandbox220618log] 34892	CDK CLI will collect telemetry data on command usage starting at version 2.1100.0 (unless opted out)

	Overview: We do not collect customer content and we anonymize the
	          telemetry we do collect. See the attached issue for more
	          information on what data is collected, why, and how to
	          opt-out. Telemetry will NOT be collected for any CDK CLI
	          version prior to version 2.1100.0 - regardless of
	          opt-in/out. You can also preview the telemetry we will start
	          collecting by logging it to a local file, by adding
	          `--unstable=telemetry --telemetry-file=my/local/file` to any
	          `cdk` command.

	Affected versions: cli: ^2.0.0

	More information at: https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/34892


32775	(cli): CLI versions and CDK library versions have diverged

	Overview: Starting in CDK 2.179.0, CLI versions will no longer be in
	          lockstep with CDK library versions. CLI versions will now be
	          released as 2.1000.0 and continue with 2.1001.0, etc.

	Affected versions: cli: >=2.0.0 <=2.1005.0

	More information at: https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/32775
